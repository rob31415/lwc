JS module formats (CommonJS, UMD, AMD, ES6)
_____________

commonjs

for server-side. "The CommonJS require() is a synchronous call, it is expected to return the module immediately. This does not work well in the browser."

// someModule.js
exports.doSomething = function() { return "foo"; };
// anotherModule.js
var someModule = require('someModule');

implementations: browserify (commonjs for browsers)


amd (Asynchronous Module Definition)

for browser-side.

// usage
require(["package/myModule"], function(myModule) {
    myModule.foobar();
    
    // export (expose) foo to other modules as foobar
    return {
        foobar: function() {return "bla";}
    }
});

implementations: requirejs


es6 style

import defaultMember from "module-name";
export { myFunction }; 


rxjs - declarative dataflow with functional programming like composition (e.g. iteration factored out)
flux - like choreography from soa, just loosly coupled components with an event broadcast bus between them; drawback: you don't clearly see the higher level program flow from the code, just a bunch of actions and dispatches of actions 
redux - event sourcing for the model, just a technicality to make flux better
jsx - js+xml
